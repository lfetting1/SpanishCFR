10/04 Made all of the voiced stops into stops. The cascade was set up to produce them as fricatives or stops in variation, but now it is only stops.

C.1.D. 3-07 Changed context of phi aspiration from [+syl] to [-cons]. See B.1.C.
C.2. Narrowing
C.2.A. 11/22 - Changed modern glide fortition rule so that it only applies to /j/, and not /w/ 
C.2.B. 2/14 - Changed "renucleation" so that it never occurs word finally

E. Rule separation
