10/04 Made all of the voiced stops into stops. The cascade was set up to produce them as fricatives or stops in variation, but now it is only stops.

$TODO check marking of phi-rule content.


A. Rule Insertion
A.1 Insertion of phenomena that are similar to phenomena in the baseline cascade. 
A.1.1 2/14 Added a rule deleting unstressed vowels when in hiatus with the same vowel. Catches words that are missed by unlong
A.1.2. 5/30 Inserted a rule that sends ʎ back to l before a round vowel with primary stress that precedes m.
A.2 Insertion of phenomena that is completely new
A.2.1 ŋɡ > n̪n̪ between front vowels, with posterior followed by coronal (ringīre > reñir, quīngentōs > quinientos; altho not in data also cingere tingere stringere etc. Not gingīva, verecundia etc.) 
A.2.2: b > ɣʷ in [-voi] ([+son]) Vhi __ u l (not -il) [CM]
A.2.3: ɸ > p / m __   just before Old Spanish -- [CM]
A.3 "New" phenomena that are well known in Romance literature. 
A.3.1 unrounding of front round vowels in Vulgar Latin inserted. [CM]
A.3.2 devoicing of d͡ʒ in clusters, bleeding dʒ > ʝ phenomena (hordeolum, virdia, verecundia, gaudium; gingiva, argilla; admordium). Bled by A.3.1 though. [CM] 
A.3.3 ɣʷ > v. Bleeds what would otherwise be passage to ɣ due to labiovelar unrounding. [CM]
A.3.4:  w or rather its reflex ɣʷ deleted before front vowels in hiatus just after j emerges from i, but before e [slightly different from French wehre it operates on ʝ but that is somewhat a matter of style. (originally from DiaCLEF, modified) [CM]
A.3.5: V (B) B L clusters to ʎ (part of phi rules) [CM]
A.4 From DiaCLEF.
B. Rule Relocdation
B.1 Relocdation Early
B.1.A. Gamma deletion moved to much earlier as sequel to early velar deletion rule right after mid lowering.
B.1.B. Betacism relocdated earlier.
B.1.C. 3-07 Phi aspiration, phi > eff, and h deletion relocdated earlier as part of fixes to f debuccalization. See C.1.D. . As of 5/30~31, covers vl too. 
B.1.D. degemination rules moved to just before Old Spanish. [CM]
B.2. Relocdation Later
B.2.1. Moved unstressed epsilon to e to after mid-lowering (now broadened to all syllables)
B.2.2. Moved postalveolar affricate to alveolar shift to after lambda re-coronalization. The former counterbleeds the latter. [CM]
C. Changes in Conditioning
C.1.Broadening
C.1.A. 2-14 - BDG deletion - B is deleted between i and a back vowel. Brings five words to regularity.
C.1.B. 2-14 Delta deletion broadened to include cases before /u/
C.1.C. 2-14 Context for modern syneresis changed from [-prim] to [-stres]
C.1.D. 3-07 Changed context of phi aspiration from [+syl] to [-cons]. See B.1.C. As of 5/30~31, [CM], covers /vL/ too. 
C.1.E. 5-30 l palatalizes before all vowels, not just unround after p. 
C.1.F. 5-30 g deletion broadened to after long back vowels. (fa:geam > aya, cogitam > cuida etc.) [CM]
C.1.G. b-deletion broadened to cover v too. [CM]
C.2. Narrowing
C.2.A. 11/22 - Changed modern glide fortition rule so that it only applies to /j/, and not /w/ 
C.2.B. 2/14 - Changed "renucleation" so that it never occurs word finally
C.2.C. 5-30 - Voiceless stops no longer delete before l, only ʎ
C.2.D g/ɣ iotation ("velar yod early") doesn't apply to ɣʷ/gʷ [CM] (trivial)
C.2.E betacism now only prevocoid or -rV. Previously context free, but that counterbleeds unification of vl phenomena with phi aspiration. [CM]
C.2.F cheismo restricted after h. 
C.3 Reshaping -- narrowing in some areas, broadening in otehrs. 
C.3.A 5-30 ʝ deletion (formerly blocked before round vowels) is now blocked between back vowels. 
C.3.B phi-deletion broadened to include v too, with new unifying contexts, while avoiding loss of f before /w/. [CM] (5/30~31)
D. Rule Deletion
D.1 ɣʷ > b deleted. Merger does not happen until much later. [CM]
E. Rule separation
