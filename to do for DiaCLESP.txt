-Change prior context from [+syll] to [-cons] for DELETE BDG (Done 9/20)
-Add a rule that fixes trills and taps. Hartman does this as part of his rules to go from latin to  ipa, but we will need our own rule.
-Resolve inconsistencies between our lexicon and cascade. For example, Hartman's rules, and therefore, BaseCLESP assume voiced obstruents to be phonemically fricatives, but our lexicon assumes them to be stops. This is probably not a huge source of error, but we should reach a decision about how to proceed. As of 9/27, Confusion of Î² for b is the 5th most common error, and one that probably can be easily resolved (done 10/04)
-Fix metaphony rules, especially the agent J rules in DiaClesp as well as BaseClesp. Hartman's are bled, but ours are not, and they are producing results they definitely are not meant to. Since Hartman's are bled, though, it is hard to know what they actually are meant to do.
- Move back secondary stress deletion in the cascade
- BaseCLESP begins with a bandaid rule that affects diphthongs. Rewrite Diaclesp to be accurate without bandaid rule 
-Move "back monophthongization" rule in the cascade. There are two of them to account for a persistent rule, maybe they could just apply one time somewhere between them? The first occurrence has been commented out as it was causing errors
-Fix delete bdg rule
-
