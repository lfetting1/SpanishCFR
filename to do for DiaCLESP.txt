-Change prior context from [+syll] to [-cons] for DELETE BDG (Done 9/20)
-Add a rule that fixes trills and taps. Hartman does this as part of his rules to go from latin to  ipa, but we will need our own rule.
-Resolve inconsistencies between our lexicon and cascade. For example, Hartman's rules, and therefore, BaseCLESP assume voiced obstruents to be phonemically fricatives, but our lexicon assumes them to be stops. This is probably not a huge source of error, but we should reach a decision about how to proceed. As of 9/27, Confusion of Î² for b is the 5th most common error, and one that probably can be easily resolved
-Fix metaphony rules, especially the agent J rules in DiaClesp as well as BaseClesp. Hartman's are bled, but ours are not, and they are producing results they definitely are not meant to. Since Hartman's are bled, though, it is hard to know what they actually are meant to do.
