Known issues:
Metaphony rules - check
Very low priority - bowem missing some kind of monophthongization (just one word)
Palatalization - false positive (not a huge deal)
Metathesis rules - not clear, seems to be hard to figure out the deal (false negative?)
Expected ɡɾo# is ɾo - false positive, improper deletion of g.
∅ for l  
	ʝg - lg (in cases from latin ll) probably false  negative (fixed - moved late syncope earlier #win. brings 5 words up to regularity and breaks none). 
	metathesis rule (false negative)
	There is an issue with [+cons] ʎ falsely turning into t͡ʃ
