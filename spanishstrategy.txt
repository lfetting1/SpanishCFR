Known issues:
Metaphony rules - check
Very low priority - bowem missing some kind of monophthongization (just one word)
Palatalization - false positive (not a huge deal)
Metathesis rules - not clear, seems to be hard to figure out the deal (false negative?)
Expected ɡɾo# is ɾo - probably false deletion of g, but maybe new rule?
∅ for l - ʝg - lg (in cases from latin ll) probably false  negative, also metathesis rule (false negative), pl - ʝ (also from latin ll) false negative
