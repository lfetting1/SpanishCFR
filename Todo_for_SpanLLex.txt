- Remove loans 
- Add more words ideally including:
	- spanish words starting with x [+front] 
	- latin words starting with s a e̯
	- see if there are words besides saponem/jabon that have s > x initially
	- words that experienced any kind of r > l sound change. milagro and peligro were both loaned from latin to old spanish, so they are not included currently, but they show the sound change. Another example would be tenebra > tiniebra > tiniebla
	- More words with modern spanish /i/, especially if unstressed
	- latin /kʷ/ in environments that could undergo syncope (middle of the word, followed by vowel), especially would be good to see a few examples of -queːre/-quiːre if possible
	- /iktu/
