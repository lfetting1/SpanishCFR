12/9 notes: Some of the o/u confusion can be resolved by changing the context of the "o raising" rule. A majority of /o/s preceding a lateral are not raised, and a majority of /o/s are raised before ɲ. There is a later rule "raising by diphthong" which incorrectly raises these again, but the pattern of that is not currently clear. Additionally, some of the words that would be raised by this later rule are attested to have been /u/ sooner. The o raising rule, the raising by diphthong, and high-lowering rules are likely the ones to examine further. This might be relevant to e/i confusion as well since these rules affect e/i too, but it is not clear in which way or if front/back metaphony shares the same conditioning environments.
